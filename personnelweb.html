					<h3>Your Pawns</h3>
					<p>Controling the center is one of the most important things in chess. Your pawns can do that. Whether it's from a distance or right on, you need to control it. </p>
					<img src="https://fthmb.tqn.com/SZIkod-nJvjUNXFk9AnqCaP6sxM=/960x0/filters:no_upscale()/Control-Center-56a136063df78cf7726868fa.jpg" alt="">
					<br>
					<p>Don't be that guy or girl who let's their oppenent gain the center, it's essential because:
						<li>You control a whole area</li>
						<li>Your pieces have more mobility</li>
						<li>It helps you develop your plans</li>
						<li>you have more freedom and space</li>
						<li>You can develop your pieces faster</li>
						<li>you have a semi-open path to the king</li>

					</p>
					<p>1 thing about listening to your pawns. Panws are pretty precious because in the endgame, they can be promoted, and protect your stronger pieces. they also tell you which way to attack. if your center pawns are diagonally attached, attack the way they point. If they are locked, semi-locked or next to each other. puch the center or break.</p>

					<h3>Have a Plan</h3>
					<p>You always, always, always have to have a plan. Anylize the moves your oppenent does, and see what they are trying to aim for. Once you Identified it, shut it down. always take down your oppenents strategy before you work on your own.</p>

					<img src="http://thechessworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/defense1-300x300.jpg" alt="">
					<p>That being said, don't just play, and make random moves. do some kind of tactics, or book move. Aim for their weakspots. Find if they can lose a piece, blunder, expose their king, get forced mate, or get into a really bad position. always look for the weakest pawn, or piece. The least protected place or piece. It will come. If you see a good move or combonations of moves. calculate carefully and surely before commiting to it.</p>

					<h3>Making Your Own Position</h3>
					<p>When developing, make sure you don't make weaknesses in your position, such as:
						<li>making unneccesary pawn movements</li>
						<li>avoid doubled pawns</li>
						<li>keep your pieces organized</li>
						<li>let all your pieces do some kind of work</li>
						<li>don't sarifice unneccesaringly, or for fun.</li>
						<li>don't open the position up if you are behind in development</li>
						<li>keep your pawns all together</li>
						<li>think very carefully about making a move</li>
						<li>the value of a piece is not only it's point value but the work it's doing and the position it's in</li>

					<h3>Calculating</h3>
					<p>Chess needs calculations. But chess is about 10% calculating, and 90% tactics, and positions. Chess masters rely mostly on tactics that were pre-made. They are more accurate and more thoroughly thought. Memorize a bunch of these and your games will improve.</p>

					<p>when your opponent does this stuff to you, then you will know how to defend against it.</p>
					<p>starting positions are also important, they can affect how your game go's. using one that fits you right is important, and knowing variations will help you defend against other positions. Go find some right now!</p>

					<h3>Mind Games and After Game</h3>
					<p>
						<li>overestimate your opponent. It will get you thinking.</li>
						<li></li>
						<li>play at full force, even in a bad position. Who knows, you might be able to turn it around.</li>
						<li>think yourself as an equal rated player as your opponent. Overconfidence can lead to loss.</li>
						<li>don't stress too much over time controls</li>

						<li>always look at your mistakes. They help you learn.</li>
