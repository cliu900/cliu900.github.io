		Mountsfield Public School was established in 1940 in what is now referred to as London's Old South. The school got its name from the person who donated the land for the construction of the school. The rule was that the school must be named after the donators ancestral property in England. For more than 40 years, Mountsfield has been the home school for a Grade 7/8 Congregated gifted class, one of four of these special classes offered by the TVDSB.
